### **Replit AI Prompt: Develop FairPay Laos â€“ Cross-Border Payment Solution**  

**Objective:**  
Build a **multi-currency e-wallet & QR payment system** for Laos, enabling tourists, expats, and local businesses to transact seamlessly with low fees.  

#### **Key Features to Implement:**  
1. **User App (Tourists/Expats):**  
   - Registration via **passport + foreign phone number** (no Lao bank needed).  
   - Top-up in **USD, THB, EUR** via:  
     - International cards (Stripe/PayPal).  
     - Thai bank transfers (PromptPay integration).  
   - Real-time **currency exchange (0.5% fee)**.  
   - QR code scanner for payments.  

2. **Vendor App (Lao Businesses):**  
   - Business KYC onboarding.  
   - QR code generator for payments.  
   - Instant settlement to e-wallet (withdraw to BCEL/BFL).  

3. **Backend & Compliance:**  
   - Partner with **BCEL/BFL** for Lao QR payment standards.  
   - **Bank of Laos** regulatory compliance (transaction limits, KYC).  
   - Multi-currency ledger (track LAK, USD, THB balances).  

#### **Tech Stack Request:**  
- **Frontend:** React Native (cross-platform iOS/Android).  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (API for transactions).  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (user accounts, transaction logs).  
- **Security:** JWT auth, AES-256 encryption.  
- **APIs Needed:**  
  - BCEL/BFL QR payment API.  
  - Stripe/PromptPay for top-ups.  
  - OpenExchangeRates API for FX.  

#### **Step-by-Step Guidance Needed:**  
1. **Setup:** How to structure the Replit project (monorepo for app + backend)?  
2. **User Auth:** Best way to handle passport-based KYC without OTP?  
3. **QR Payments:** How to integrate Lao bank QR standards (e.g., BCEL One)?  
4. **FX Engine:** Code logic for real-time exchange (+0.5% fee).  
5. **Testing:** Simulate transactions in a sandbox environment.  

#### **Example Code Request:**  
```javascript
// Sample: QR payment flow (user scans vendor QR)
function handlePayment(userId, vendorId, amountLAK) {
  // 1. Check user balance
  // 2. Deduct amount + 0.5% fee
  // 3. Credit vendor (instant)
  // 4. Log transaction
}
```

**Priority:**  
- Start with **MVP** (user top-up + QR pay) â†’ later add virtual cards, cashback.

### **How to Use This Prompt in Replit AI:**  
1. Open **Replit** (replit.com) and create a new project (Node.js + React Native).  
2. Use the **AI Chat Assistant** (or Ghostwriter) and paste this prompt.  
3. Refine responses with follow-ups like:  
   - *"How to integrate BCELâ€™s QR API in Node.js?"*  
   - *"Show React Native UI for the wallet screen."*  

This keeps the AI focused on **Laos-specific payment needs** while leveraging Replitâ€™s collaborative coding features.
